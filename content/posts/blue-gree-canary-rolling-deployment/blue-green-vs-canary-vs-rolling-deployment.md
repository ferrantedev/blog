In this post we will compare the most popular deployment strategies, namely:

- Rolling
- Blue-Green
- Canary


# Rolling Deployments

It's the simplest deployment strategy which involves updating software systems by gradually replacing instances in a rolling fashion. Here's how it generally works:

- The new version of the software is deployed on a subset of instances, while the remaining instances continue to run the previous version.
- Traffic is then gradually shifted from the old instances to the new instances, ensuring a smooth transition.
- Once the new instances are confirmed to be stable, the process continues by updating the remaining instances.
- This sequential update process continues until all instances are running the new version.

Rolling Deployments allow for a **controlled and incremental update** of the software system, ensuring that a certain portion of the system is always operational. It also provides an opportunity to monitor the impact of the new version on performance and detect any issues early on.


# Blue-Green deployments

Briefly, it's a software release strategy that involves maintaining two identical production environments, namely the "blue" and the "green" environment. The blue environment represents the current live system, while the green environment represents the updated version that is being deployed. Here's how it works:

- Initially, all user traffic is routed to the blue environment, which is the stable and running production version.
- The updated version of the software is deployed to the green environment, which remains idle during this phase.
- Once the green environment is successfully deployed and tested, the traffic routing is switched from the blue to the green environment, making it the new live system.
- If any issues arise, it's easy to roll back by redirecting the traffic back to the blue environment.

The key advantages of Blue-Green Deployments include **minimal downtime and reduced risk during software releases**, as the previous version remains intact until the new version is thoroughly tested.

# Canary Deployments

In a nutshell, it's a release strategy that focuses on gradually rolling out new features or updates to a subset of users, allowing for testing and monitoring before a wider release. Here's how it typically works:

- Initially, a small portion of user traffic (canary group) is diverted from the main production environment to the newly deployed version (canary version).
- The canary group represents a small, representative subset of users who are more tolerant of potential issues.
- The behavior and performance of the canary version are closely monitored, collecting metrics and user feedback to assess its stability.
- If the canary version performs well without issues, the deployment can proceed to a broader audience.
- If any problems are detected, the deployment can be halted or rolled back before affecting the majority of users.

Canary Deployments allow for **controlled testing and gradual rollout** of new features, minimizing the impact of potential issues by targeting a smaller user base initially.


# Picking the best strategy

Depending on the nature of the application your team may prefer a deployment strategy over the other as each strategy has it's own benefit/drawback.

Minimal risk and downtime, go with Blue-Green and Canary Deployments as they both provide a safety net and allow for rollbacks if issues occur.

Low Maintenance cost, go with Canary and Rolling Deployments, as they typically work with a single production environment. Blue-Green Deployments involve maintaining two separate environments, which can be expensive.  

Feature testing, go with Canary Deployments, as they allow to target a subset of users for testing, while Blue-Green and Rolling Deployments involve updating the entire production environment.

Gradual release process, go with Rolling Deployments as they offer a gradual update process, whereas Blue-Green and Canary Deployments can involve a switch from one version to another more abruptly.

# In summary

Blue-Green Deployments excel in minimizing downtime and risk during releases, Canary Deployments are useful for controlled testing with a subset of users, and Rolling Deployments offer a gradual update process for the entire production environment. The choice among these strategies depends on specific deployment requirements, risk tolerance, and
