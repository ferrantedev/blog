# Hello world!

A couple of years ago I came to realize that I want to share my software engineering knowledge and perspective with the rest of the world. 

The idea came while working with Keycloak, a awesome product that allows to provide authorization and authentication to a web application I was developing at the time.

Unfortunately the idea was never executed until now!

I want to use this blog to regularly post about software products, especially those that are used to build software products. Such as:

- Keycloak
- Postgres
- Sqlite
- Elasticsearch
- Ionic
- Nextjs
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- ArgoCD

And many many more!
