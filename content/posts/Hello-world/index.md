# Hello world!

A couple of years ago I came to realize that I want to share my software engineering knowledge and perspective with the rest of the world. 

The idea came while working with Keycloak in a hobby project.

Unfortunately the idea was never executed until today!

I want to use this blog to regularly post about software products, especially those that are used to build software products. Such as:

- Keycloak
- Postgres
- Sqlite
- Elasticsearch
- Ionic
- Nextjs
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- ArgoCD

And many many more, stay tuned!
