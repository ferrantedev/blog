      <description>Hello world! A couple of years ago I came to realize that I want to share my software engineering knowledge and perspective with the rest of the world.
The idea came while working with Keycloak, a awesome product that allows to provide authorization and authentication to a web application I was developing at the time.
Unfortunately the idea was never executed until now!
I want to use this blog to regularly post about software products, especially those that are used to build software products.</description>
