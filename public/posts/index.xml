      <description>In this post we will compare the most popular deployment strategies, namely:
Rolling Blue-Green Canary Rolling Deployments It&amp;rsquo;s the simplest deployment strategy which involves updating software systems by gradually replacing instances in a rolling fashion. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it generally works:
The new version of the software is deployed on a subset of instances, while the remaining instances continue to run the previous version. Traffic is then gradually shifted from the old instances to the new instances, ensuring a smooth transition.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a Supply Chain Attack? Basically it&amp;rsquo;s when a malicious actor swaps one of the software components with a compromised one.
Nowadays, the great majority of consumer-facing software, such as webapps or mobile apps, make use of third party software components in the form of libraries.
Consider the following image as an example. It depicts a standard app which makes use of components such as Searcher, Monitoring, Math, etc.
These components are created and maintained, by third party organizations, often by individuals from the open source community.</description>

      <description>Hello world! A couple of years ago I came to realize that I want to share my software engineering knowledge and perspective with the rest of the world.
The idea came while working with Keycloak in a hobby project.
Unfortunately the idea was never executed until today!
I want to use this blog to regularly post about software products, especially those that are used to build software products. Such as:</description>
